Indeed, the results you provided for confidence, interest, lift, and standardized lift seem odd. Let's analyze each of them:

    Confidence (confidence_k2):
        Confidence values represent the probability of finding item B in a transaction given that item A is already present in the transaction. These values should typically range between 0 and 1.
        However, the confidence values in your results are unusually low, with some values even below 0. This suggests that there might be an issue with the calculation.

    Interest (interest_k2):
        Interest measures the interestingness of association rules. Normally, interest values should also range between 0 and 1.
        In your results, all interest values are 0, which is highly unusual. This indicates that there might be a problem with the interest calculation.

    Lift (lift_k2):
        Lift measures how much more likely item B is to be bought when item A is bought, compared to when item A is not bought.
        The lift values in your results seem to be similar to confidence values, which is not typical. Lift values should generally be greater than or equal to 1.

    Standardized Lift (standardized_lift_k2):
        Standardized lift adjusts the lift value to account for randomness and provides a standardized measure of lift.
        The standardized lift values also seem unusual, with some values not falling within the typical range.

Given these observations, it's likely that there's an issue with the calculation or the input data. I would recommend double-checking the implementation of these calculations and verifying the input data to identify any potential errors. Additionally, reviewing the logic for each calculation step might help in diagnosing the problem.
